I will implement the changes to the Chat UI and Model Detection logic as requested.

### 1. UI Updates (ChatScreen.kt)
*   **Move Deep Thinking Button**: 
    *   Refactor the chat input area layout. Wrap the existing input row in a `Column`.
    *   Move the "Deep Thinking" toggle from the left of the input box to the **top-left** of the input box.
*   **Redesign Button**:
    *   Replace the icon-only button with a **text-based button** ("深度思考").
    *   Style it with a **rounded border** (Capsule or RoundedRect shape).
    *   **States**:
        *   **Active**: Primary color text/border (or filled).
        *   **Inactive**: Outline/Gray text.
    *   Ensure proper alignment with the start of the input field.

### 2. Logic Updates (ModelInfo.kt)
*   **Enhance Detection Mechanism**:
    *   Update the `supportsDeepThinking` property in `ModelInfo` data class.
    *   **New Logic**: In addition to `ModelType.REASONING` models, also return `true` if the model ID contains keywords like:
        *   `"mimo"` (for Xiaomi MiMo models)
        *   `"pro"` (for Pro models)
        *   (and potentially others like `"max"`, `"ultra"` to be future-proof)
    *   This ensures these models are recognized as supporting the "Deep Thinking" feature, allowing users to toggle the mode manually, even if they are not strictly classified as "Reasoning" models by the system type.

### 3. Verification
*   I will verify that the button appears in the correct location and matches the visual description.
*   I will verify that the toggle is enabled for "mimo" and "pro" models.
