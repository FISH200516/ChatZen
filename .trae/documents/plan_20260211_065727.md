I will update the code to enable vision capabilities for Volcengine (Doubao) models. The main issue is that the current model configuration does not correctly flag these models as supporting vision, and the specific vision-capable models are missing from the registry.

### Plan

1.  **Update `ModelInfo.kt`**:
    *   Modify the `supportsVision` property logic to automatically infer vision support from model IDs (e.g., checking for "vision", "gpt-4o", "claude-3", "gemini", "doubao").
    *   Add `doubao-1.5-vision-pro` (32k) to the `ModelRegistry` under `Provider.VOLCENGINE`.
    *   Add `doubao-1.5-pro-32k` to the `ModelRegistry` as a standard chat model (though recent versions often have implicit vision, we will be explicit with the vision-specific model first).

2.  **Verify `ChatRepository.kt`**:
    *   The current implementation uses the standard OpenAI-compatible format for image transmission (`type: "image_url"`, `url: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."`), which aligns with the "Chat API" section of the provided Volcengine documentation. No changes are needed here unless the image format handling needs generalization, but sticking to the working pattern is safer.

### Changes to be made

**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/fishai/chatzen/data/model/ModelInfo.kt`

```kotlin
// In ModelInfo class
val supportsVision: Boolean
    get() {
        if (overrideVisionSupport == true) return true
        
        val lowerId = id.lowercase()
        return lowerId.contains("vision") || 
               lowerId.contains("gpt-4o") || 
               lowerId.contains("claude-3") || 
               lowerId.contains("gemini") || 
               (provider == Provider.VOLCENGINE && lowerId.contains("doubao")) // Assuming Doubao models generally support vision or we specifically added vision ones
    }

// In ModelRegistry object
ModelInfo("doubao-1.5-vision-pro-32k", "Doubao 1.5 Vision Pro", Provider.VOLCENGINE, 1727740800, ModelType.CHAT),
```

Note: I will be more precise with `supportsVision` to avoid enabling it for text-only legacy models if possible, but enabling it for "doubao" and "vision" covers the requirement.
